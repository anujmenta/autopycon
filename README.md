# autopycon
An automatic crawler-scraper which will keep the users updated about CFP dates and deadlines. 

The premise of the script is to base all the updates based on twitter handles of the official Pycon accounts and periodically scrape them to update the database and intimate the subscribers about the CFP and deadlines so that they don't have to keep checking a website and add all these to their calendars. 

Contributions, Feedback, Thoughts etc. are welcome!
